# Doom3 From Scratch
Doom3 Clone From Scratch

## Why Do This Proeject
i had maked some indie games with Unity game engine [Google PlayStore](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.milli.findkiller2&hl=ko) .
But Unity gives everything what I need. I didn't have to know How does Unity Engine work behind Editor UI.
So Although i had made many games for 3 years, Still i can't make just tiny game without Game Engine.

It's suck

So I decided making game without game engine.
And I choose Doom3 as My first game from sractch Project.
It's really famouse game and A lot of people love this game.
And Since it has a lot of resources (textures, 3d models.....), I can focus only on Programming.

I don't know How long it takes to complete this project.
But I will complete this project!!



And i never make game from scratch.
So if you wanna good and clean code or learning something, Find other project.
